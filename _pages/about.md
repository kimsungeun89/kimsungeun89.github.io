I am currently a Ph.D. student specializing in Modern Korean History at the [Department of Asian Languages and Cultures, University of Californiaâ€“Los Angeles (UCLA)](http://www.alc.ucla.edu/). I work with Professor [Namhee Lee](http://www.international.ucla.edu/cks/person/364). **My research interest is on the transnational history of militarization in Korea**, initiated during Japan's imperial war-mobilization (1931-45), reconfigured under US occupation (1945-48), and further cultivated under Korea's authoritarian regimes (1948-87).

I hold a [M.A. in East Asian Regional Studies from Columbia University](http://weai.columbia.edu/academics/marsea/), and a B.A. in Asian Studies and Political Science from [Vassar College](https://www.vassar.edu/).
