## A Shout-out to the World from Los Angeles!
My first posting begins with the mood of a cool breeze in L.A.'s summer, as we are seeing a record high temperatures on the other side of the globe in Korea.

This blog is getting kick-started (a.k.a. "It Begins") as my second year of PhD program at UCLA winds down, and I've finally decided to listen to my peers on creating a blog. I'm excited to share my interests in Korean history and society with a broader audience. *~~Definitely not because of the fact that informal writing is a small escape from my profession.~~*

L.A. is a living history of diasporic Korean community, and places like [LACMA's Korean art collections](http://www.lacma.org/art/collection/korean-art) constantly inspire my intellectual growth.

For those of you who know me personally, it will come as no surprise that a picture of my airplane ride is included here. I am a huge fan of world traveling, esp. on occurred mileage points. A significant portion of this blog will be devoted to my travels, dining and subsequent thoughts that arise amidst.
