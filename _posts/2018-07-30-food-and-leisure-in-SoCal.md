## Some Food and Fun to Roll the Mind.
Over the years, I've lived in a handful of cities around the world. Living in a city as a foreigner is no small challenge, and it's often because the culinary options are never the same for back home and abroad. Los Angeles, however, is an anomaly. If you enjoy various Korean culinary delicacies, the name [L.A.'s Koreatown](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/koreatown-los-angeles/index.html) would make your heart skip a beat. Even for a Korean, the range of food option is baffling at times.

According to CNN, L.A.'s Koreantown never sleeps. Besides the stereotyping of "Koreans" along ethnic/cultural lines, I'd point out to you that so many other places in L.A. and the broader SoCal would leave one awake throughout the night. For example, the hip-and-savvy bars in downtown and grilled chicken over gravy mole sauce in San Diego.

Still, the standard meal for typical U.S. college/graduate student is probably pizza. It's cheap, accessible, and best for munchies over chit-and-chat with friends. One of my favorite pizza shops around UCLA is [Enzo's Pizzeria](http://www.enzospizzeria.com/). You can choose the toppings here, and the crispness of the dough coming right out of the brick-oven is phenomenal.

But by far the best meal is one shared with friends. Whether you are a graduate student in for a doctoral program at least half a decade long or working tirelessly to live on in the world of capitalism, we are in it for the long run. That's why I find the need to savor the moments of sharing good food with even greater people.
